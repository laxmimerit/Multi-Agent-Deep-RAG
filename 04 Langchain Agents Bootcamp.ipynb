They are Trailing Twelve Month PE Ratio (TTM) or PE Ratio (TTM) (TTM), [Forward PE Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/forward-pe-ratio/MSFT), or [PE Ratio without NRI](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/penri/MSFT). A new PE Ratio (TTM) based on inflation-adjusted normalized PE Ratio (TTM) is called [Shiller PE Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/shiller-pe-ratio/MSFT), after Yale professor Robert Shiller.\\\\n\\\\nIn the calculation of PE Ratio (TTM), the earnings per share used are the earnings per share over the past 12 months. For [Forward PE Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/forward-pe-ratio/MSFT), the earnings are the expected earnings for the next twelve months. In the case of [PE Ratio without NRI](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/penri/MSFT), the reported earnings less the non-recurring items are used.\\\\n\\\\nFor [Shiller PE Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/shiller-pe-ratio/MSFT), the earnings of the past 10 years are inflation-adjusted and averaged. Since it looks at the average over the last 10 years, [Shiller PE Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/shiller-pe-ratio/MSFT) is also called PE10.\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft\\\\xa0\\\\xa0(NAS:MSFT) PE Ratio (TTM) Explanation\\\\n\\\\nThe PE Ratio (TTM) can be viewed as the number of years it takes for the company to earn back the price you pay for the stock. For example, if a company earns $2 a share per year, and the stock is traded at $30, the PE Ratio (TTM) is 15. Therefore it takes 15 years for the company to earn back the $30 you paid for its stock, assuming the earnings stays constant over the next 15 years.\\\\n\\\\nIn real business, earnings never stay constant. If a company can grow its earnings, it takes fewer years for the company to earn back the price you pay for the stock. If a company\\\\\\'s earnings decline it takes more years. As a shareholder, you want the company to earn back the price you pay as soon as possible. Therefore, lower P/E stocks are more attractive than higher P/E stocks so long as the PE Ratio (TTM) is positive. Also for stocks with the same PE Ratio (TTM), the one with faster growth business is more attractive.\\\\n\\\\nIf a company loses money, the PE Ratio (TTM) becomes meaningless.\\\\n\\\\nTo compare stocks with different growth rates, Peter Lynch invented a ratio called [PEG Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/peg-ratio/MSFT). [PEG Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/peg-ratio/MSFT) is defined as the PE Ratio (TTM) divided by the growth ratio. He thinks a company with a PE Ratio (TTM) equal to its growth rate is fairly valued. Still he said he would rather buy a company growing 20% a year with a PE Ratio (TTM) of 20, instead of a company growing 10% a year with a PE Ratio (TTM) of 10.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the PE Ratio (TTM) measures how long it takes to earn back the price you pay, the PE Ratio (TTM) can be applied to the stocks across different industries. That is why it is the one of the most important and widely used indicators for the valuation of stocks.\\\\n\\\\nSimilar to the [PE Ratio without NRI](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/penri/MSFT) or [PS Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/MSFT)or [Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/price-to-operating-cash-flow/MSFT)or [Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/price-to-free-cash-flow/MSFT), the PE Ratio (TTM) measures the valuation based on the earning power of the company. This is where it is different from the [PB Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pb-ratio/MSFT), which measures the valuation based on the company\\\\\\'s balance sheet.\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\nBe Aware\\\\n\\\\nInvestors need to be aware that the PE Ratio (TTM) can be misleading a lot of times, especially when the underlying business is cyclical and unpredictable. As Peter Lynch pointed out, cyclical businesses have higher profit margins at the peaks of the business cycles. Their earnings are high and PE Ratio (TTM)s are artificially low. It is usually a bad idea to buy a cyclical business when the PE Ratio (TTM) is low. A better ratio to identify the time to buy a cyclical businesses is the [PS Ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/MSFT).\\\\n\\\\nPE Ratio (TTM) can also be affected by non-recurring-items such as the sale of part of businesses. This may increase for the current year or quarter dramatically. But it cannot be repeated over and over. Therefore [PE Ratio without NRI](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/penri/MSFT) is a more accurate indication of valuation than PE Ratio (TTM).\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n## Microsoft PE Ratio (TTM) Related Terms\\\\n\\\\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Microsoft\\\\\\'s PE Ratio (TTM) provided by GuruFocus.com.

      "Here's a data-driven analysis of Apple's revenue and a comparison with its key competitors for the quarter ended September 30, 2025:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Apple's Revenue Performance:**\n",
      "Apple reported a strong fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, with **$102.5 billion** in quarterly revenue. This included a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and an all-time revenue record for Services, highlighting the continued strength of its core hardware product and the significant growth of its ecosystem-driven services. For the full fiscal year 2025, Apple's revenue reached $416 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Competitor Revenue Comparison:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a comprehensive comparison, I analyzed the latest quarterly revenues of Apple's major competitors across its various segments:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Alphabet (Google):** Reported consolidated revenues of **$102.3 billion** for the quarter, placing it in a very similar revenue bracket as Apple. Google Services (including Search, YouTube ads, Android, and devices) contributed $87.1 billion, while Google Cloud saw significant growth, reaching $15.2 billion.\n",
      "*   **Microsoft:** Achieved revenues of **$77.7 billion** for its FY26 Q1. Microsoft's strong performance was primarily driven by its Microsoft Cloud segment, which generated $49.1 billion (up 26%), with Azure and other cloud services growing by 40%. Productivity and Business Processes (Microsoft 365, LinkedIn) brought in $33.0 billion, and More Personal Computing (Windows, Xbox, Search) accounted for $13.8 billion.\n",
      "*   **Samsung:** Reported consolidated revenue of KRW 86.1 trillion, which is approximately **$63.8 billion USD** (using an approximate exchange rate of 1 USD = 1350 KRW) for the same quarter. Samsung's Device Solutions (semiconductors) division saw a 19% increase in sales, and its Device eXperience (mobile and consumer electronics) division grew by 11%, boosted by new foldable phone launches and flagship sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Insights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Top-Tier Revenue Scale:** Apple and Alphabet stand out with very similar quarterly revenues exceeding $102 billion, indicating their immense scale and global market penetration. Microsoft also demonstrates a substantial revenue base, showcasing its broad influence across various tech sectors.\n",
      "2.  **Diverse Revenue Drivers:**\n",
      "    *   **Apple:** Continues to rely heavily on its hardware ecosystem, particularly the iPhone, with its Services segment showing impressive growth and becoming an increasingly vital revenue stream.\n",
      "    *   **Alphabet:** Dominates in digital advertising through Google Search and YouTube, while its cloud computing arm (Google Cloud) is a rapidly expanding segment.\n",
      "    *   **Microsoft:** Exhibits strong leadership in cloud services (Azure) and enterprise software, with its traditional Windows and Xbox businesses contributing as well.\n",
      "    *   **Samsung:** Shows strength across a diverse portfolio, including semiconductors (memory chips), smartphones, and other consumer electronics.\n",
      "3.  **Cloud as a Growth Engine:** Both Microsoft and Alphabet are experiencing robust growth in their cloud computing divisions, indicating a significant industry shift towards cloud-based solutions and a key area of investment and competition among tech giants.\n",
      "4.  **Hardware Resilience:** Despite the highly competitive market, Apple's iPhone and Samsung's mobile sales continue to demonstrate strong consumer demand for premium devices.\n",
      "5.  **The AI Race:** All companies emphasized their strategic investments and advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This indicates that AI is not just a technological trend but a critical factor driving product innovation and future revenue growth across the tech industry. Microsoft specifically highlighted its \"planet-scale cloud and AI factory,\" and Alphabet underscored its \"full stack approach to AI.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Apple maintains a leading position in the tech landscape with strong revenue, particularly from its iPhone and growing services. However, it faces formidable competition from diversified giants like Alphabet and Microsoft, who are leveraging their cloud and software strengths, and from Samsung, with its broad hardware manufacturing capabilities. The increasing focus on AI across all these companies signals that innovation in this area will be crucial for competitive advantage and market share in the coming years.\n"
