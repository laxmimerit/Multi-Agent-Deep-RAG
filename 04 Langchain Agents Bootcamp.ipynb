Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed to its current name in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple has been described as a Big Tech company.\\\\nThe company was founded to market Wozniak&#39;s Apple I personal computer. Its successor, the Apple II, became one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984 as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal conflicts led to Jobs leaving the company to form NeXT and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as CEO for over a decade.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.)\\\\nCEO\\\\n* [Tim Cook]()\\\\nFounded\\\\nApr 1, 1976\\\\nHeadquarters\\\\n[Cupertino, California\\\\nUnited States]()\\\\nEmployees\\\\n166,000\\\\nDiscover more\\\\nYou may be interested in\\\\n*info*\\\\nThis list is generated from recent searches, followed securities, and other activity.[Learn more](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9853763)\\\\nAll data and information is provided “as is” for personal informational purposes only, and is not intended to be financial advice nor is it for trading purposes or investment, tax, legal, accounting or other advice.

Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed to its current name in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple has been described as a Big Tech company.\\\\nThe company was founded to market Wozniak&#39;s Apple I personal computer. Its successor, the Apple II, became one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984 as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal conflicts led to Jobs leaving the company to form NeXT and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as CEO for over a decade.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.)\\\\nCEO\\\\n* [Tim Cook]()\\\\nFounded\\\\nApr 1, 1976\\\\nHeadquarters\\\\n[Cupertino, California\\\\nUnited States]()\\\\nEmployees\\\\n166,000\\\\nDiscover more\\\\nYou may be interested in\\\\n*info*\\\\nThis list is generated from recent searches, followed securities, and other activity.[Learn more](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9853763)\\\\nAll data and information is provided “as is” for personal informational purposes only, and is not intended to be financial advice nor is it for trading purposes or investment, tax, legal, accounting or other advice.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.85, up 13% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, beating analyst forecasts of $1.76. Services revenue hit a new all-time high, contributing to a record fiscal year revenue of $416 billion with double-digit EPS growth.\\n\\nKey highlights include:\\n*   **Revenue:** $102.5 billion (vs. $101.69 billion forecast)\\n*   **EPS:** $1.85 (vs. $1.76 forecast)\\n*   **Services Revenue Growth:** 15% year-over-year.\\n*   **Fiscal Year Revenue:** $416 billion.\\n\\nChallenges noted were supply chain constraints affecting iPhone models and a 4% decline in the Greater China market year-over-year.
