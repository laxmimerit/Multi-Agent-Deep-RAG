## Apple's Profitability Performance (Net Income, EPS, and Margins) in 2023 and 2024

### Focused Query 1: What was Apple's net income and EPS performance in FY 2023 vs FY 2024?
Apple's bottom-line results in 2024 were significantly impacted by a one-time tax event, despite strong operational growth.

*   **Net Income:**
    *   **FY 2024:** $93.74 billion (a 3.3% decrease from 2023).
    *   **FY 2023:** $97.00 billion.
    *   The primary driver for the 2024 decline was a **one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion** related to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling on Irish state aid. Without this charge, net income would have shown year-over-year growth.
*   **Earnings Per Share (Diluted):**
    *   **FY 2024:** $6.08 (a 0.8% decrease from 2023).
    *   **FY 2023:** $6.13.
    *   The impact on EPS was less severe than the impact on net income because Apple continued its aggressive share buyback program, reducing the weighted-average diluted shares from 15.81 billion in 2023 to 15.41 billion in 2024.

### Focused Query 2: How did Apple's margins (Gross and Operating) evolve?
Apple saw significant margin expansion in 2024, reaching record levels driven by favorable product mix and cost efficiencies.

*   **Gross Margin:**
    *   **FY 2024:** 46.2% ($180.7 billion).
    *   **FY 2023:** 44.1% ($169.1 billion).
    *   **Expansion:** +210 basis points.
    *   **Segment Drivers:**
        *   **Products Gross Margin:** Rose from 36.5% in 2023 to **37.2%** in 2024, aided by cost savings and favorable product mix.
        *   **Services Gross Margin:** Rose from 70.8% in 2023 to **73.9%** in 2024, driven primarily by higher net sales and a different mix of services.
*   **Operating Income:**
    *   **FY 2024:** $123.22 billion (7.8% increase).
    *   **FY 2023:** $114.30 billion.
    *   Operating income grew faster than revenue (which grew ~2%), reflecting strong operational leverage and the high-margin nature of the Services segment.

### Focused Query 3: What were the key operating expense trends and tax impacts?
*   **Operating Expenses:** Apple maintained disciplined spending, though investment in R&D continued to rise.
    *   **Total Operating Expenses (2024):** $57.47 billion (14.7% of sales).
    *   **Research and Development (R&D):** Increased 5% to $31.37 billion in 2024, primarily due to headcount-related expenses.
    *   **Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A):** Increased 5% to $26.10 billion.
*   **Effective Tax Rate:**
    *   **FY 2024:** 24.1% (compared to 14.7% in 2023).
    *   The sharp increase was due to the $10.2 billion Irish tax charge confirmed by the ECJ in September 2024.

### Summary
Apple's underlying profitability remained extremely robust in 2024, with record-high gross margins and strong operating income growth (+7.8%). However, the reported net income and EPS for FY 2024 showed a slight year-over-year decline due to a massive $10.2 billion one-time tax charge resulting from the European Court of Justice's decision on the Irish state aid case. Excluding this non-recurring item, Apple’s profitability metrics would have reached all-time highs, supported by a 210-basis point expansion in gross margin and the continued growth of the high-margin Services business.
