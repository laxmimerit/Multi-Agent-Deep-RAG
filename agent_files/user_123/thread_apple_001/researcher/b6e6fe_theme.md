### Focused Query 2: Apple performance Greater China 2023 2024 challenges
Greater China has been a significant area of concern for Apple during this period:
- **Revenue Decline:** Sales fell by 2% in 2023 and accelerated to an 8% decline in 2024.
- **Product Weakness:** The 2024 decline was primarily attributed to lower net sales of **iPhone** and **iPad**. iPhone revenue represents a "moderately higher proportion" of net sales in Greater China compared to other segments, making the region particularly sensitive to iPhone cycles.
- **Currency Headwinds:** The weakness of the **renminbi (RMB)** relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on net sales in both the third quarter and the full fiscal year of 2024.
- **Competitive Pressure:** While not explicitly naming domestic rivals in the 10-K, Apple notes "aggressive price competition" and "downward pressure on gross margins" from competitors who imitate product features and use lower-priced products to gain market share.

### Focused Query 3: Regional Growth Drivers and Highlights
- **Americas:** Returned to growth (+3%) in 2024 after a 4% dip in 2023, driven primarily by higher net sales of **Services**.
- **Europe (including India):** Outperformed other regions with 7% growth in 2024. This was driven by strength in both **Services and iPhone** sales. Notably, India is included in the "Europe" segment, and its growth has been a key highlight in management commentary.
- **Japan:** Showed a 3% increase in 2024 net sales, primarily from higher **iPhone** sales, despite significant headwinds from the weak yen.
- **Rest of Asia Pacific:** Grew 4% in 2024, largely due to higher **Services** revenue.

### Summary
Apple's geographic performance in 2023 and 2024 reflects a tale of two trajectories. While the **Americas and Europe** (including India) recovered and drove growth in 2024 through Services and iPhone demand, **Greater China** faced a deepening contraction. The 8% revenue drop in China during 2024 was a major headwind, caused by a combination of lower iPhone demand amidst fierce local competition, iPad sales declines, and unfavorable currency exchange rates. Despite these regional challenges, Apple's overall global revenue returned to 2% growth in 2024, buoyed by the resilience of the Services segment and recovery in Western markets.
