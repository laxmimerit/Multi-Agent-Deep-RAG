### Analysis
Apple's margins have trended upward in 2024. This expansion is primarily driven by:
1.  **Services Growth:** The Services segment, which carries significantly higher margins than hardware products, grew to represent a larger portion of total revenue.
2.  **Product Mix:** Shift toward "Pro" models in the iPhone lineup and higher storage tiers.
3.  **Operational Efficiency:** Lower cost of sales in the Products segment ($140.7B in first 9 months of 2024 vs $146.7B in 2023) despite relatively stable sales volume.

The gross margin of 46.2% in the first nine months of 2024 represents a notable improvement over the 44.1% recorded in the full year 2023.
