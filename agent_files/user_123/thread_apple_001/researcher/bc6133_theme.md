**2023 Performance Highlights:**
*   **iPhone:** Sales decreased by 2% due to lower sales of non-Pro models, though partially offset by higher Pro model demand.
*   **Mac:** Experienced a significant 27% decline ($10.8 billion) primarily due to lower laptop sales following a pandemic-related surge in previous years.
*   **iPad:** Sales fell 3% due to lower demand for iPad mini and iPad Air.
*   **Services:** Was a bright spot, growing 9% with higher sales across all lines of business.

**2024 Performance Highlights:**
*   **iPhone:** Remained the dominant revenue source, staying relatively flat at $201.2 billion.
*   **Mac:** Showed a slight recovery with 2% growth, driven by higher net sales of laptops.
*   **iPad:** Declined 6% overall for the year, though it saw a sharp 24% rebound in the third fiscal quarter ($7.16 billion) following the launch of new iPad Pro and iPad Air models.
*   **Wearables, Home and Accessories:** Continued to decline, falling 7% as sales for wearables and accessories softened.
*   **Services:** Reached an all-time high of $96.2 billion, growing 13%. Growth was fueled by advertising, the App Store, and cloud services.

### Analysis

The financial data from 2023 and 2024 reveals a significant shift in Apple's growth engine. While the iPhone continues to provide a massive and stable revenue base (accounting for roughly 51-52% of total sales), it has entered a period of stagnant growth. In contrast, the **Services** segment has emerged as the company's primary growth driver, increasing its contribution to total revenue from 22.2% in 2023 to 24.6% in 2024.

The "iPad" and "Wearables" segments have faced headwinds, with 2024 seeing declines in both. However, the iPad segment demonstrated the impact of product cycles; the introduction of new models in mid-2024 led to a temporary double-digit quarterly surge, even if the annual total was down. The Mac segment is stabilizing after the post-pandemic correction seen in 2023.

### Summary

Apple's performance in 2023 and 2024 is characterized by a "two-speed" economy within its product portfolio. The hardware segments (iPhone, iPad, Wearables) are largely mature or cyclical, showing flat to declining annual growth. Conversely, the Services segment is experiencing robust, double-digit growth (13% in 2024), effectively offsetting hardware softness and driving a 2% increase in total company revenue to $391 billion in fiscal 2024. This shift highlights Apple's successful transition toward a more recurring, high-margin revenue model centered on its ecosystem rather than just device sales.
