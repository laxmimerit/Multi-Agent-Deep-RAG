### Analysis

Apple's stock performance in 2024 was characterized by a strong recovery in the latter half of the fiscal year, outperforming the S&P 500 Index (which returned roughly 35% growth in the same period vs 2019 baseline, but Apple's 2024 fiscal jump from $322 to $430 indicates a strong momentum year). 

The launch of **Apple Intelligence** in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 served as a major catalyst for the stock, as management positioned generative models as a central part of the iOS, macOS, and iPadOS ecosystems. Despite flat iPhone sales and declines in iPad/Wearables for the full fiscal year 2024, the market reacted positively to the growth in Services (up 13%) and the potential for an AI-driven hardware replacement cycle.

### Summary

In 2024, Apple's stock returned over 33% to shareholders on a fiscal year basis, ending the year with a market cap exceeding $2.6 trillion. Analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus with a mean price target near $288, anticipating that the integration of generative AI (Apple Intelligence) across its device lineup and continued double-digit growth in the Services segment will sustain valuation. While 2024 saw headwinds in certain hardware categories like the iPad and Wearables, the strategic pivot toward AI and the stability of the iPhone segment remain the primary pillars of the analyst outlook.
