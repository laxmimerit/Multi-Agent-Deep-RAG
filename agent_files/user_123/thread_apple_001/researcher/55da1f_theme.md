Despite a slight dip in net income in 2024 ($93.7B vs $97.0B in 2023), operating cash flow grew by approximately 7%, demonstrating the efficiency of Apple's business model. The company continues to maintain a "net cash neutral" goal, progressively reducing its cash surplus by returning it to investors.
