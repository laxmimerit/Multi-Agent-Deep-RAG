## Performance of Apple's Product Segments (2023-2024)

Apple's financial performance during 2023 and 2024 was characterized by a significant shift in its revenue mix, with Services becoming a more dominant growth driver while product segments experienced varying degrees of volatility and recovery.

### iPhone
The iPhone remains Apple's largest revenue source, showing relative stability despite global economic pressures.
- **FY 2023:** Revenue was $200.6 billion, a 2% decrease from 2022. The decline was attributed to lower sales of non-Pro models, though partially offset by strength in the higher-margin Pro models.
- **FY 2024:** Revenue grew slightly to $201.2 billion (relatively flat year-over-year). While the second quarter of 2024 saw a 10% dip due to tough year-over-year comparisons and timing of Pro model sales, the segment stabilized by the end of the year.

### Services
Services was the standout performer, reaching all-time revenue records throughout 2023 and 2024.
- **FY 2023:** Revenue grew 9% to $85.2 billion, fueled by higher sales across all lines of business (advertising, video, and cloud services).
- **FY 2024:** Revenue surged 13% to $96.2 billion. This growth was primarily driven by advertising, the App Store, and cloud services. Services now represents nearly 25% of Apple's total net sales.

### Mac
The Mac segment faced a significant downturn in 2023 but showed signs of recovery in 2024.
- **FY 2023:** Revenue plummeted 27% to $29.4 billion (down from $40.2 billion in 2022). This was due to a market-wide slowdown in personal computers and a tough comparison to the M1-chip-driven surge in the previous year.
- **FY 2024:** Revenue recovered slightly to $30.0 billion, a 2% increase. Growth was primarily driven by higher sales of laptops (MacBook Air/Pro).

### iPad
The iPad segment saw consistent declines over the two-year period, largely due to a lack of major product refreshes in 2023.
- **FY 2023:** Revenue was $28.3 billion, a 3% decrease.
- **FY 2024:** Revenue fell further to $26.7 billion, a 6% decrease. However, a significant 24% year-over-year jump in Q3 2024 (following the release of new M4 iPad Pro and iPad Air models) helped mitigate earlier losses.

### Wearables, Home and Accessories
This segment, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, experienced a cooling period after years of rapid growth.
- **FY 2023:** Revenue was $39.8 billion, a 3% decrease.
- **FY 2024:** Revenue fell 7% to $37.0 billion. The decline was primarily driven by lower sales of Wearables and Accessories, despite the introduction of the Apple Vision Pro in early 2024 (which is categorized in this segment).
