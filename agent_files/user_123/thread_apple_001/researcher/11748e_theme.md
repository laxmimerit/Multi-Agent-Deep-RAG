## Performance Breakdown by Product and Service Segment (2023-2024)

### Focused Query 1: Apple FY2023 Segment Performance (Full Year)
In fiscal year 2023 (ended Sept 30, 2023), Apple reported a total revenue of $383.3 billion, a 3% decrease from 2022. The segment breakdown was as follows:
- **iPhone:** $200.6 billion (representing ~52% of total revenue), down 2% YoY. The decrease was attributed to lower sales of non-Pro models, partially offset by higher sales of Pro models.
- **Services:** $85.2 billion (representing ~22% of total revenue), up 9% YoY. This was a record high, driven by growth across all lines of business including advertising, App Store, and cloud services.
- **Wearables, Home and Accessories:** $39.8 billion, down 3% YoY. The decline was primarily due to lower sales of Wearables and Accessories.
- **Mac:** $29.4 billion, down 27% YoY. This sharp decline was due to a market-wide slowdown in PC demand and lower laptop sales.
- **iPad:** $28.3 billion, down 3% YoY. Lower sales of iPad mini and iPad Air were the main factors, though partially offset by newer iPad models.

### Focused Query 2: Apple FY2024 Segment Performance (First Nine Months)
For the nine months ended June 29, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023:
- **iPhone:** $155.0 billion, down 1% YoY. Sales remained relatively flat as the product line faced intense competition and macroeconomic pressure.
- **Services:** $71.2 billion, up 13% YoY. Services continued to be the strongest growth driver, consistently hitting new revenue records and increasing its share of Apple's total revenue.
- **Mac:** $22.2 billion, up 2% YoY. The segment showed signs of recovery with increased laptop sales.
- **iPad:** $19.7 billion, down 10% YoY for the 9-month period. However, **Q3 2024 (April–June)** saw a massive **24% increase** in iPad revenue ($7.2B vs $5.8B) following the release of new M4 iPad Pro and M2 iPad Air models.
- **Wearables, Home and Accessories:** $28.0 billion, down 8% YoY. This segment continued to face challenges in year-over-year comparisons.

### Focused Query 3: Comparative Analysis and Segment Trends
- **Growth Engine:** The **Services** segment has transitioned into Apple's primary growth engine, growing at double-digit rates (13% in 2024) and providing higher margins compared to hardware.
- **Product Lifecycle Impact:** The iPad segment's 2024 performance highlights the impact of product refreshes; revenue surged 24% in the most recent quarter (Q3 2024) after a prolonged period of decline.
- **Mac Recovery:** After a difficult 2023 where Mac sales fell 27%, the segment has stabilized and returned to modest growth (2%) in 2024.
- **iPhone Resilience:** Despite the -1% to -2% fluctuations, the iPhone remains the bedrock of Apple's financials, maintaining a revenue base of over $200 billion annually.

### Summary
Apple's financial performance in 2023 and 2024 is characterized by a "Services-led" growth strategy. While hardware segments like the iPhone and Wearables have faced slight contractions or flat growth due to macroeconomic factors and longer replacement cycles, the Services segment has consistently delivered record-breaking results. The 2024 fiscal year also marks a notable recovery for the Mac and a strong rebound for the iPad following new hardware releases.
