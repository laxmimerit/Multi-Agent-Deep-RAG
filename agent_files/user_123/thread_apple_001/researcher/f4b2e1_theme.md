### Analysis by Segment

- **iPhone:** Remained the largest revenue contributor, representing over 51% of total sales. Performance was relatively flat as the market matured, though the launch of iPhone 15 and 16 cycles provided stability.
- **Services:** This was the standout performer, growing 13% year-over-year. Key drivers included advertising, cloud services, and the App Store. Services now account for nearly 25% of total revenue, up from 22% in 2023.
- **Mac:** Showed a modest recovery (+2%) after a significant 27% decline in 2023. Growth was primarily driven by updated MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models.
- **iPad:** Continued to struggle with a 6% decline in 2024, following a 3% decline in 2023. The decrease was attributed to lower sales of iPad Pro and entry-level models, though new Air models provided some offset.
- **Wearables, Home and Accessories:** Experienced a 7% decline. This segment, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, faced tough comparisons and a slower upgrade cycle in 2024.

### Summary
The transition toward a service-oriented model is clear, with **Services** being the primary engine of revenue growth and margin expansion. While **iPhone** maintains the core install base, the decline in **iPad** and **Wearables** highlights a cooling in non-iPhone hardware categories, partially offset by the stabilization of the **Mac** business.
