### Analysis
Apple's revenue showed a slight recovery in 2024 compared to 2023. While 2023 saw a 3% decline in net sales due to macroeconomic headwinds and foreign exchange volatility, 2024 benefited from strong performance in the Services segment and a stabilized iPhone market. The 2023 fiscal year was also unique as it spanned 53 weeks, whereas 2024 returned to a 52-week cycle. Despite the one-time tax charge in Q4 2024 which lowered net income for the year, operating performance remained robust.
