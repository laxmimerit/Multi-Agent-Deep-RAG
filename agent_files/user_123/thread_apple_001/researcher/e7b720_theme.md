### Analysis
Apple's capital return strategy evolved from a "maintenance" mode in 2023 to a "highly aggressive" mode in 2024. While 2023 saw a reduction in buybacks compared to 2022 ($77.6B vs $89.4B), 2024 marked a massive surge to nearly $95 billion. This escalation was supported by a $110 billion increase in authorization announced in May 2024. 

The most striking trend is the disconnect between net income and capital return; in FY 2024, Apple returned ~$16 billion more to shareholders than it earned in net income, funded by its robust operating cash flow and vast cash reserves. This "net cash neutral" goal continues to drive their financial policy, aiming to eventually balance their cash and debt levels.

### Summary
In 2023 and 2024, Apple solidified its position as the global leader in capital returns. Over the two-year period, the company returned over **$202 billion** to shareholders.
*   **2023 Key Metric:** Returned 95% of net income ($92.6B).
*   **2024 Key Metric:** Returned 117% of net income ($110.2B).
*   **Growth:** Operating cash flow remained strong, growing from $110.5B to $118.3B.
*   **Policy:** The program is anchored by a record-breaking $110B buyback authorization and consistent, modest annual dividend increases.
