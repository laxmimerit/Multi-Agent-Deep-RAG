### Analysis
The expansion in Apple's margins is a result of two primary factors:
1.  **Services Growth:** The Services segment, which commands a gross margin roughly double that of the Products segment (74% vs 35-37%), is becoming a larger portion of the total revenue mix. This structural shift naturally pulls the consolidated margin higher.
2.  **Product Efficiency:** Despite inflationary pressures and currency headwinds (weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar), Apple has successfully implemented cost savings in its hardware supply chain, helping to stabilize Products margins in the 35-37% range.

Operating expenses have risen, specifically in R&D (driven by headcount), but the significant gains in gross profit have more than offset these costs, leading to an expansion in operating margin from ~29.8% in 2023 to ~31.6% in 2024.

### Summary
Apple's financial health in 2023 and 2024 is characterized by **significant margin expansion**. Gross margins grew from **44.1% in FY 2023** to **46.2% for the first nine months of FY 2024**. This was mirrored by operating margin growth from **29.8% to 31.6%** over the same period. The primary engine of this improvement is the high-margin Services segment, which now consistently delivers gross margins above 70%.
