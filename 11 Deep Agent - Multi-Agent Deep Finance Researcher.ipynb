Introduction\\nThis report provides a detailed comparison of the revenue and profitability of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. for the 2024 period. The analysis is based on Apple's full fiscal year 2024 (which ended September 28, 2024) and Amazon's reported results for the first nine months of the 2024 calendar year (January through September 2024).\\n\\n## 2. Apple 2024 Financial Overview (Fiscal Year)\\nApple's fiscal year 2024 saw a return to revenue growth, driven primarily by its Services segment and a recovery in Mac sales.\\n\\n### Key Financial Metrics (FY 2024)\\n*   **Total Revenue:** $391,035 million (+2.0% YoY) [1].\\n*   **Gross Margin:** $180,683 million (46.2% margin), up from 44.1% in 2023 [1].\\n*   **Operating Income:** $123,216 million (31.5% margin), a significant increase from $114,301 million in 2023 [1].\\n*   **Net Income:** $93,736 million (24.0% margin). Note that net income was negatively impacted by a $10.2 billion one-time tax charge related to a European Court of Justice decision [1][4].\\n\\n### Revenue Breakdown by Segment\\n*   **iPhone:** $201,183 million (+0.3% YoY)\\n*   **Services:** $96,169 million (+12.9% YoY) - A record high for the company.\\n*   **Mac:** $29,984 million (+2.1% YoY)\\n*   **Wearables, Home and Accessories:** $37,005 million (-7.1% YoY)\\n*   **iPad:** $26,694 million (-5.7% YoY)\\n\\n## 3. Amazon 2024 Financial Overview (First 9 Months)\\nAmazon demonstrated robust growth in 2024, characterized by a massive scale in retail and high-margin growth in its cloud (AWS) and advertising businesses.\\n\\n### Key Financial Metrics (9-Month Total: Jan-Sept 2024)\\n*   **Total Net Sales:** $450,167 million (Approx. +11% YoY growth across the periods) [5][6][7].\\n*   **Gross Margin:** $222,772 million (49.5% margin) [5][6][7].\\n*   **Operating Income:** $47,390 million (10.5% margin), which represents a 100.4% increase compared to the first nine months of 2023 [7].\\n*   **Net Income:** $39,244 million (8.7% margin) [7].\\n\\n### Revenue Breakdown by Segment (9-Month Total)\\n*   **Online Stores:** $171,473 million\\n*   **Third-party Seller Services:** $108,661 million\\n*   **AWS (Cloud):** $78,770 million (+17-19% YoY growth)\\n*   **Advertising Services:** $38,926 million (+19-24% YoY growth)\\n*   **Subscription Services (e.g., Prime):** $32,866 million\\n\\n## 4. Detailed Comparison\\n\\n### Revenue Scale vs. Profitability\\nThe comparison reveals a stark difference in business models between the two giants:\\n\\n*   **Revenue Scale:** Amazon operates at a significantly larger revenue scale. In just nine months of 2024, Amazon's revenue ($450.2 billion) has already exceeded Apple's total revenue for its entire 12-month fiscal year ($391.0 billion).\\n*   **Profitability Margins:** While Amazon leads in revenue, Apple remains the leader in profitability efficiency. Apple’s operating margin of **31.5%** is triple that of Amazon’s **10.5%**. This reflects Apple's premium hardware and high-margin services ecosystem compared to Amazon's high-volume, lower-margin retail operations.\\n*   **Net Income:** Despite the one-time $10.2 billion tax hit, Apple's net income for FY2024 ($93.7 billion) is more than double Amazon's net income for the first nine months ($39.2 billion).\\n\\n### Growth Drivers\\n*   **Apple:** Growth is increasingly reliant on **Services** (+12.9%), which now accounts for nearly 25% of total revenue. Hardware growth (iPhone, Mac) remains stable but slow.\\n*   **Amazon:** Growth is diversified but led by **AWS** and **Advertising**. AWS continues to be the primary engine of operating income, while the advertising segment is growing at nearly 20% or more per quarter.\\n\\n### Segment Comparison\\n*   **High-Margin Services:** Both companies are pivoting toward high-margin services. Apple's Services ($96.2B) is comparable in scale to Amazon's AWS ($78.8B for 9 months), but they serve different markets (Consumer vs. Enterprise).\\n*   **Geographic Trends:** Apple faced challenges in Greater China (-7.7% revenue decline in FY2024), whereas Amazon's international and North American retail segments showed steady improvement in efficiency.\\n\\n## 5. Conclusion\\nApple and Amazon both entered 2024 from positions of strength but with different focuses. Apple remains a profitability powerhouse, successfully leveraging its massive install base to grow recurring service revenue. Amazon, meanwhile, has significantly improved its operating efficiency, doubling its operating income in 2024 while maintaining a top-line growth rate that outpaces Apple's. For investors and analysts, the trade-off remains between Apple's elite margins and Amazon's superior revenue scale and accelerating cloud/advertising growth.\\n\\n## 6. Sources\\n[1] Apple Inc.

      "\n",
      "*   **Revenue Scale:** Amazon's revenue for just the first nine months of 2024 ($450.2 billion) already exceeds Apple's total revenue for its entire 12-month fiscal year ($391.0 billion). This highlights Amazon's massive retail and cloud scale.\n",
      "*   **Profitability Efficiency:** Apple remains the profitability leader. Its operating margin of **31.5%** is triple that of Amazon’s **10.5%**. Apple's ability to command premium prices for hardware and high-margin services (46.2% gross margin) remains its core strength.\n",
      "*   **Growth Engines:** \n",
      "    *   **Apple** is increasingly reliant on its **Services** segment, which grew **12.9%** and hit a record $96.2 billion in revenue.\n",
      "    *   **Amazon** is driven by **AWS** (up 19% YoY) and **Advertising** (up ~20% YoY), which are significantly more profitable than its core retail business.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Challenges:** Apple saw a **7.7% decline** in revenue from Greater China, while Amazon focused on improving international retail efficiency and expanding its cloud footprint.\n",
