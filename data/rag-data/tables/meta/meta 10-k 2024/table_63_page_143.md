Plans with Charles Schwab typically utilize specified determinants regarding date(s), prices(s), start and end dates and share amounts to be sold under the 10b5-1 plan using a template provided by Charles Schwab. Plans with Charles Schwab cannot include determinants that are derived through employee or director-provided formulas or algorithms, but can include volume weighted average price (VWAP).
3. Number of Shares : There is no limitation on the number of shares that a 10b5-1 plan can cover; however, each individual share of stock can only be covered by one (1) 10b5-1 plan. In addition, there must be a sufficient number of shares in the 10b5-1-related brokerage account to cover any balance of shares available for sale under the applicable 10b5-1 plan.
4. Duration : A 10b5-1 plan cannot have a duration longer than two years.
5. Absolute  Discretion  of  the  10b5-1 Compliance Officer :  The  10b5-1  Compliance  Officer  shall  have  absolute  discretion  to  suspend  an  employee  or director's  eligibility  under  this  policy  or  otherwise  take  appropriate  measures  in  the  event  that  an  employee  or  director  appears  to  be  cancelling  or modifying their plan(s) in a serial fashion and/or in a manner that is not in keeping with the spirit of Rule 10b5-1.
6. Further Guidance for Section 16 Officers : Employees designated by Meta as subject to the disclosure requirements of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and directors should be mindful of SEC filing requirements and stockholder concerns when designing their 10b5-1 plans.
