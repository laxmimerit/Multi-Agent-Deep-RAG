**3. Tables:**
*   There are no tables present on this page. All numerical data is presented graphically in the bar chart.

**4. Text Content:**
*   **Title:** "Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)" clearly defines the metric being presented.
*   **Footnote (bottom left):** This text provides a crucial definition and context:
    *   "Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we define average revenue per person (ARPP) as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of DAP at the beginning and end of the quarter." This clarifies the calculation method for ARPP from Q1'24 onwards, using "FoA revenue" (likely "Family of Apps" revenue) and "DAP" (Daily Active Persons).
    *   "We have recast ARPP in prior periods for comparative purposes." This important statement indicates that the ARPP values for Q2'23, Q3'23, and Q4'23 have been recalculated or adjusted to align with the new definition introduced in Q1'24, ensuring consistency and comparability across all quarters presented in the chart.
*   **Page Number:** "11" is displayed at the bottom right.

In summary, the document is a concise financial slide from Meta, presenting the quarterly trend of Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP) from Q2'23 to Q2'25.
