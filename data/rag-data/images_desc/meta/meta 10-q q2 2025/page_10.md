**4. Text Content**

*   **Main Title:** "Family Daily Active People (DAP)" - This is the central metric being presented.
*   **Subtitle:** "In Billions" - Specifies the unit for the DAP metric.
*   **Footnotes (Two paragraphs at the bottom):**

    *   **Paragraph 1: Definition of Daily Active Person (DAP)**
        *   Defines a DAP as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp. These products are collectively referred to as "Family" products.
        *   To qualify, a user must have visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or a web/mobile browser on a given day.
        *   Crucially states that DAP numbers do *not* include users on other Meta products (beyond the "Family" suite) unless those users would otherwise qualify as DAP based on their activity within the specified Family products.

    *   **Paragraph 2: Methodology and Limitations**
        *   Explains that Meta does not require people to use a common identifier or link accounts to use multiple Family products.
        *   Therefore, Meta employs "complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models" to estimate the underlying number of unique people.
        *   These calculations involve matching user accounts within individual products and across multiple products to attribute activity to a single person, effectively counting groups of accounts as one person.
        *   The techniques and models require "significant judgment" and are developed based on internal reviews of limited user samples and calibration against user survey data.
        *   Acknowledges that there is "necessarily some margin of error" in these estimates.
        *   Refers to a separate section, "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" (likely in an appendix), for additional information.
        *   **Important Disclosure:** States that "Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users." This change in methodology is significant and should be considered when comparing data across periods, although the chart shows continued growth even after this change.
