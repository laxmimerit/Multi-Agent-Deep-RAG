### Charts and Graphs:

The page features a single, large **stacked column chart** that illustrates the breakdown of expenses as a percentage of revenue across different quarters.

*   **Chart Type:** Stacked Column Chart. Each column represents a specific quarter, and the height of each segment within the column represents a particular expense category's percentage of revenue for that quarter.
*   **X-axis (Horizontal Axis):** This axis displays the quarters, spanning two years: Q2'23, Q3'23, Q4'23, Q1'24, Q2'24, Q3'24, Q4'24, Q1'25, and Q2'25. This provides a historical view and extends into a near-future projection or estimate.
*   **Y-axis (Vertical Axis):** While not explicitly labeled with a numerical scale, the Y-axis implicitly represents percentages, as all data points within the bars are given as percentages. The total height of each stack represents the total expenses as a percentage of revenue for that quarter.
*   **Legend and Color Scheme:** The legend on the right uses distinct shades of grey to differentiate the expense categories:
    *   **Lightest Grey:** General & Administrative (G&A)
    *   **Medium-Light Grey:** Marketing & Sales
    *   **Medium-Dark Grey:** Research & Development (R&D)
    *   **Darkest Grey:** Cost of Revenue (CoR)

#### Data Trends and Key Insights:

Let's analyze the trends for each expense category and the total expenses:

1.  **Cost of Revenue (CoR - Darkest Grey, Bottom Segment):**
    *   This category remains remarkably stable, primarily at **18%** of revenue, with slight fluctuations to **19%** in Q2'23, Q4'23, and Q2'24.
    *   *Insight:* CoR represents a consistent proportion of revenue, suggesting a stable operational cost structure directly tied to revenue generation.

2.  **Research & Development (R&D - Medium-Dark Grey, Second from Bottom):**
    *   Starts at **29%** in Q2'23.
    *   Generally declines to **27%** (Q3'23), **26%** (Q4'23), then stabilizes around **27-28%** through Q3'24.
    *   Experiences a significant dip to **25%** in Q4'24.
    *   Rebounds sharply to **29%** in Q1'25, then settles to **27%** in Q2'25.
    *   *Insight:* R&D is consistently the largest or second-largest expense category. While showing some quarterly variations, particularly the dip in Q4'24 and rebound in Q1'25, it generally hovers in the mid-to-high 20s as a percentage of revenue.

3.  **Marketing & Sales (Medium-Light Grey, Third from Bottom):**
    *   Begins at **10%** in Q2'23.
    *   Shows a clear downward trend, dropping to **8%** (Q3'23, Q4'23) and then stabilizing at **7%** from Q1'24 through Q1'25.
    *   Further decreases to **6%** in Q2'25.
    *   *Insight:* This category demonstrates a sustained effort to reduce marketing and sales expenses relative to revenue, almost halving its percentage share from the initial period to the end of the observed period.

4.  **General & Administrative (G&A - Lightest Grey, Top Segment):**
    *   Starts at a high of **13%** in Q2'23.
    *   Undergoes a sharp reduction to **6%** in Q3'23 and Q4'23.
    *   Increases to **9%** in Q1'24 and Q2'24.
    *   Drops again to **5%** in Q3'24.
    *   Reaches its lowest point at **2%** in Q4'24.
    *   Increases to **5%** in Q1'25 and **6%** in Q2'25.
    *   *Insight:* G&A is the most volatile expense category, showing significant and rapid adjustments. The dramatic drop in Q4'24 to 2% is particularly notable, followed by a partial rebound. This suggests active management and potentially one-off factors influencing this category.

#### Total Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue (Sum of all segments):

*   **Q2'23:** 71% (19+29+10+13)
*   **Q3'23:** 59% (18+27+8+6) - Significant drop
*   **Q4'23:** 59% (19+26+8+6)
*   **Q1'24:** 61% (18+27+7+9) - Slight increase
*   **Q2'24:** 62% (19+27+7+9) - Slight increase
*   **Q3'24:** 58% (18+28+7+5) - Drop
*   **Q4'24:** 52% (18+25+7+2) - Lowest point
*   **Q1'25:** 59% (18+29+7+5) - Rebound
*   **Q2'25:** 57% (18+27+6+6) - Slight decrease

*   **Overall Insight:** The total expenses as a percentage of revenue demonstrate a significant overall reduction from 71% in Q2'23 to a low of 52% in Q4'24. This reduction is primarily driven by substantial cuts in General & Administrative and Marketing & Sales expenses. Although there's a rebound to 59% in Q1'25, total expenses remain considerably lower than the initial period, settling at 57% by Q2'25. The company appears to have implemented significant cost-efficiency measures, particularly impacting G&A and Marketing & Sales.
