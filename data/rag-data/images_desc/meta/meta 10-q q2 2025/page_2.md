*   **Chart Type:** Stacked Column Chart. Each vertical column represents the total advertising revenue for a specific quarter. Each column is segmented into four distinct color blocks, representing the revenue contributed by different geographic regions.
*   **X-axis (Horizontal Axis):** Represents time, specifically financial quarters. The labels are: Q2'23, Q3'23, Q4'23, Q1'24, Q2'24, Q3'24, Q4'24, Q1'25, Q2'25. This covers a period of nine quarters.
*   **Y-axis (Vertical Axis):** Represents Advertising Revenue. While there are no explicit tick marks or labels on the vertical axis itself, the total revenue for each quarter is clearly labeled at the top of each column, and the revenue for each geographic segment is labeled within its respective colored block. The title "In Millions" clarifies the units.
*   **Legend:** Located on the right side of the chart, it uses four distinct shades of gray/blue to differentiate the geographic regions, from lightest to darkest:
    *   Lightest Gray: Rest of World

**3. Text Content:**

*   **Main Title:** "Advertising Revenue by User Geography" – Clearly defines the subject of the data.
*   **Subtitle:** "In Millions" – Specifies the units for all monetary values presented.
*   **Footnote:** "Our revenue by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers."
    *   **Summary:** This crucial disclaimer explains the methodology for geographic revenue attribution. It clarifies that the data presented here is an *estimation based on user location* during activity that generates revenue. It also explicitly states that this method *differs* from the official financial statement disclosures, which apportion revenue based on *customer addresses*. This distinction is important for understanding the context and potential differences between this internal analysis and formal financial reporting.

**In summary,** the document provides a clear, quarter-by-quarter breakdown of Meta's advertising revenue, segmented by four major geographic regions. It illustrates a consistent growth trend in revenue across all regions from Q2'23 to Q2'25, with US & Canada being the dominant revenue driver, followed by Europe. The chart also highlights seasonal patterns, with revenue typically peaking in Q4. A significant footnote clarifies the methodology used for this specific geographic apportionment.
