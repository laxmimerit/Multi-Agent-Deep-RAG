This financial document page, titled "Average Price Per Ad YoY Percentage Change," presents a detailed analysis of ad price growth across various global regions. The page features a clean, minimalist design with a white background, dark grey text, and dark blue-grey bar charts. The Meta logo (an infinity symbol with "Meta") is prominently displayed in the top right corner.

**Overall Layout:**
The page is dominated by five bar charts arranged in a grid-like structure: three charts in the top row and two in the bottom row, with the position for a third chart in the bottom row left blank. Below these charts, there is a small explanatory footnote and the page number "13" at the bottom right.

**Text Content:**
*   **Main Title:** "Average Price Per Ad YoY Percentage Change" is prominently displayed at the top left, clearly indicating the subject matter.
*   **Footnote:** A small text block at the bottom left provides important context: "Our average price per ad growth by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered." This clarifies the methodology behind the regional data.
*   **Page Number:** The number "13" is located at the bottom right of the page.

**Visual Elements:**
The page uses a clean, professional aesthetic. The dark blue-grey color of the bars contrasts well with the white background, making the data easy to read. The use of direct percentage labels on each bar eliminates the need for a detailed Y-axis scale, simplifying the visual presentation. The consistent layout across all charts allows for easy comparison of trends across different geographic regions and over time. The negative value for Asia-Pacific is clearly distinguished by its bar extending below the horizontal baseline.
