*   **Overall Growth:** From Q1'23 to Q4'24, there is a general upward trend in ARPP, moving from $9.47 to a peak of $14.25.
*   **2023 Performance:** ARPP shows consistent quarter-over-quarter growth throughout 2023, starting at $9.47 in Q1'23 and reaching $12.33 by Q4'23.
*   **Q1'24 Dip:** There is a noticeable decline from the Q4'23 peak ($12.33) to Q1'24 ($11.20).

*   **Q1'25 Decline:** A significant drop occurs from the Q4'24 peak ($14.25) to Q1'25 ($12.36).
*   **Seasonal Pattern:** The pattern of a strong Q4 followed by a decline in Q1 (observed in both Q4'23 to Q1'24 and Q4'24 to Q1'25) suggests a potential seasonal effect, where ARPP peaks in the fourth quarter and then decreases in the first quarter of the following year.
*   **Highest Value:** The highest ARPP recorded is $14.25 in Q4'24.
*   **Lowest Value:** The lowest ARPP recorded is $9.47 in Q1'23.

### Tables:

There are no tables present on this page. All data is presented visually within the bar chart.

### Text Content:

1.  **Main Title (Top Left):**
    *   "Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)"
    *   This clearly identifies the metric being presented.

2.  **Company Identifier (Top Right):**
    *   "Meta" logo.
    *   Indicates that this data pertains to Meta Platforms, Inc.

3.  **Footnote/Disclaimer (Bottom Left):**
    *   "Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we define average revenue per person (ARPP) as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of DAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. We have recast ARPP in prior periods for comparative purposes."
    *   **Summary of Main Points:**
        *   **Definition of ARPP:** Starting Q1'24, ARPP is calculated as "Family of Apps (FoA) revenue" for a quarter divided by the "average number of Daily Active People (DAP)" at the beginning and end of that quarter.
        *   **Change in Definition:** This indicates a new methodology for calculating ARPP was adopted from Q1 2024 onwards.
        *   **Recasting for Comparability:** The data for prior periods (Q1'23 through Q4'23) has been retroactively adjusted ("recast") using this new definition to ensure that all figures in the chart are comparable and reflect the same methodology. This is crucial for accurate trend analysis.
