**3. Tables:**

*   There are no tables present on this page. All numerical data is presented graphically within the bar chart.

**4. Text Content:**

The bottom section of the page contains two paragraphs of explanatory text, providing definitions, methodology, and caveats related to the "Family Daily Active People (DAP)" metric.

*   **Paragraph 1 (Definition of DAP):**
    *   This paragraph defines a "daily active person (DAP)" as a registered and logged-in user of at least one of Meta's "Family" products (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp) who accessed it via a mobile app or web browser on a given day.
    *   It clarifies that DAP numbers do not include users of other Meta products unless those users also qualify as DAP through their activity on the Family products.

*   **Paragraph 2 (Methodology and Caveats):**
    *   This section explains the complexity of calculating DAP, particularly because users may have multiple accounts across various Family products without a common identifier.
    *   Meta relies on "complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models" to estimate the unique number of people, matching user accounts within and across products to attribute them to a single person.
    *   It acknowledges that these methods involve "significant judgment" and are based on "internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts" and "user survey data," implying a "margin of error" in the estimates.
    *   It directs readers to an "Appendix of this presentation" for "additional information" on "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data."
    *   A significant methodological note is included: "Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users." This indicates a change in how DAP is calculated from Q4'23 onwards.
