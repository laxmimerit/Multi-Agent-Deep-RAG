**Charts and Graphs Description:**

There are five bar charts, all sharing a similar structure and displaying "Average Price Per Ad Year-over-Year (YoY) Percentage Change" across five consecutive quarters: Q4'23, Q1'24, Q2'24, Q3'24, and Q4'24.

*   **Common Chart Elements:**
    *   **X-axis:** Each chart's horizontal axis represents time, labeled with the quarters: Q4'23, Q1'24, Q2'24, Q3'24, Q4'24.
    *   **Y-axis:** While not explicitly numbered with a scale, the vertical axis implicitly represents the YoY percentage change. A thin horizontal line at 0% serves as the baseline. Bars extending above this line indicate positive growth, while bars extending below indicate negative growth.
    *   **Bars:** The bars are a dark blue-grey color.
    *   **Data Labels:** The exact percentage change value is displayed clearly above each bar (or below for negative values).
    *   **Region Label:** Below each chart's X-axis, a light grey horizontal bar with the region name in dark grey text acts as a clear subtitle for that specific chart.

**Tables:**

There are no separate data tables on this page. All numerical data is presented directly within the bar charts as data labels.

**Text Content (Footnote):**

The small text at the bottom provides an important methodological clarification:
"Our average price per ad growth by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered."

*   **Main Point:** This statement clarifies that the geographic categorization of ad price growth is determined by the estimated location of the *user* at the time an ad is displayed, rather than, for example, the location of the advertiser or the ad's target audience. This detail is crucial for understanding the basis of the regional data.
