This document page is a financial presentation slide from Meta, focused on illustrating the trend of "Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)" over several quarters.

**Overall Layout and Visual Elements:**
The page has a clean, minimalist design with a white background. The primary content is a large bar chart.
*   **Header:** In the top left corner, the title "Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)" is prominently displayed in a large, dark grey sans-serif font.
*   **Branding:** In the top right corner, the "∞ Meta" logo is present in a distinctive blue color.
*   **Footer:**
    *   At the bottom left, there is a small paragraph of descriptive text (a footnote).

*   **Color Scheme:** The page uses a simple color palette: white for the background, dark grey/black for most text, a dark teal/blue-grey for the chart bars, and a distinct blue for the Meta logo.

**Charts and Graphs:**
The central and dominant element of the page is a **bar chart** that visualizes the "Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)" over nine consecutive quarters.
*   **Chart Title:** The chart's title is the same as the page header: "Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)".
*   **X-axis (Horizontal Axis):** This axis represents time, specifically quarters, spanning from Q4'22 to Q4'24. The labels are clearly visible beneath each bar:
    *   Q4'22
    *   Q1'23
    *   Q2'23
    *   Q3'23
    *   Q4'23
    *   Q1'24
    *   Q2'24
    *   Q3'24
    *   Q4'24
*   **Y-axis (Vertical Axis):** While there is no explicit numerical scale or label on the Y-axis, it implicitly represents the ARPP in U.S. dollars. The height of each bar corresponds to its value, which is explicitly labeled above each bar.
*   **Data Trends and Key Insights:**
    *   **Initial Period (Q4'22 - Q1'23):** The ARPP starts at **$10.68** in Q4'22 and sees a noticeable dip to **$9.47** in Q1'23, marking the lowest point in the observed period.
    *   **Recovery and Growth in 2023:** Following the Q1'23 dip, ARPP shows a steady recovery and growth throughout 2023:
        *   Q2'23: **$10.42**
        *   Q3'23: **$10.93**
        *   Q4'23: **$12.33** (reaching a new high for the period up to this point).
    *   **Fluctuation and Strong Growth in 2024:** The beginning of 2024 sees a slight decrease, possibly a seasonal dip, but then robust growth follows:
        *   Q1'24: **$11.20** (a drop from Q4'23).
        *   Q2'24: **$11.89**
        *   Q3'24: **$12.29**
        *   Q4'24: **$14.25** (the highest value recorded in the entire series, indicating significant year-over-year growth and strong performance at the end of 2024).
    *   **Overall Trend:** The general trend is upward, despite some quarterly fluctuations (notably dips in Q1 of both 2023 and 2024). The ARPP has grown significantly from $10.68 in Q4'22 to $14.25 in Q4'24. This suggests a positive trajectory for Meta's average revenue per person over this two-year period.

**Tables:**
There are no distinct tables present on this page. All numerical data is conveyed through the bar chart.

**Text Content:**
*   **Main Title:** "Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)" – This is the primary subject of the page and the chart.
*   **Footnote (Bottom Left):** This small paragraph provides crucial definitional context for the ARPP metric:
    *   "Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we define average revenue per person (ARPP) as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of DAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. We have recast ARPP in prior periods for comparative purposes."
    *   **Summary of Footnote:** This explains that from Q1'24 onward, ARPP is calculated using "FoA revenue" (likely "Family of Apps" revenue) divided by the average number of "DAP" (Daily Active People/Users) at the start and end of the quarter. Importantly, it states that the ARPP for periods prior to Q1'24 has been "recast" to ensure comparability with the new definition. This ensures that the entire dataset presented in the chart is consistent under the updated definition.
