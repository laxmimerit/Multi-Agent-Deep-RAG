### Text Content

The text content is located at the bottom of the page and provides definitions and important disclaimers regarding the "Family Daily Active People (DAP)" metric.

1.  **Definition of DAP (First Paragraph):**
    *   Defines a daily active person (DAP) as a registered and logged-in user of Meta's "Family" of products (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp).
    *   To qualify as DAP, a user must have visited at least one of these products via a mobile app or web/mobile browser on a given day.
    *   Clarifies that DAP numbers exclude users on other Meta products unless they also qualify as DAP through activity on the Family products.

2.  **Explanation of DAP Calculation and Limitations (Second Paragraph):**
    *   Explains that Meta does not require users to link accounts across products, necessitating complex methods to attribute multiple user accounts to a single individual.
    *   DAP calculations rely on "complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models" to estimate unique people, involving matching user accounts within and across products.
    *   Acknowledges that these techniques involve "significant judgment," are based on "internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts," and are "calibrated against user survey data," leading to a "margin of error in our estimates."
    *   Refers to a separate section, "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in the presentation's Appendix, for more information.
    *   States an important methodology change: "Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users." This indicates a potential slight shift in the reported numbers from Q4'23 onwards due to the exclusion of this user group.
