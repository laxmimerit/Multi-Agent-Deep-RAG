**2. Charts and Graphs:**

*   **Type:** Stacked Vertical Bar Chart.
*   **Title:** "Revenue by User Geography"
*   **Subtitle/Units:** "In Millions" (indicating all monetary values are in millions of US dollars).
*   **X-axis (Horizontal Axis):** Represents time, specifically nine consecutive quarters: Q4'22, Q1'23, Q2'23, Q3'23, Q4'23, Q1'24, Q2'24, Q3'24, and Q4'24.
*   **Y-axis (Vertical Axis):** There is no explicit Y-axis scale displayed. Instead, the total revenue for each quarter is shown at the top of its respective bar, and the revenue contributed by each geographic segment is displayed directly within its colored section of the bar.
*   **Data Representation:** Each vertical bar represents the total revenue for a given quarter, segmented by four geographic regions. The height of each segment within a bar corresponds to the revenue from that region.
*   **Legend:** Located on the right side of the chart, it defines the color-coding for the geographic segments:
    *   **Rest of World:** Lightest grey/blue
    *   **Asia-Pacific:** Medium-light grey/blue
    *   **Europe:** Medium-dark grey/blue
    *   **US & Canada:** Darkest grey/blue (almost black)

*   **Data Trends and Key Insights:**

    *   **Overall Revenue Growth:** There is a clear upward trend in total quarterly revenue over the period shown. Total revenue started at $32,165 million in Q4'22, dipped in Q1'23, and then consistently grew to reach its peak of $48,385 million in Q4'24. This represents a substantial increase of approximately 50% from Q4'22 to Q4'24.
    *   **Seasonal Pattern:** A noticeable seasonal pattern exists, where Q1 (e.g., Q1'23, Q1'24) generally shows a dip in revenue following a stronger Q4 of the previous year (e.g., Q4'22, Q4'23).
    *   **Dominance of US & Canada:** The "US & Canada" segment consistently contributes the largest portion of revenue across all quarters, often more than all other regions combined. Its revenue grew from $15,636 million in Q4'22 to $21,783 million in Q4'24.
    *   **Growth Across All Regions:** All four geographic segments show an overall increase in revenue from Q4'22 to Q4'24, indicating broad-based growth for Meta.

**3. Tables:**
There are no distinct tables presented on this page. All numerical data is embedded within the stacked bar chart itself.

**4. Text Content:**

*   **Main Title:** "Revenue by User Geography"
*   **Subtitle:** "In Millions"
*   **Company Branding:** "Meta" logo is displayed.
*   **Footnote (bottom left):** This important disclaimer clarifies the methodology for geographic revenue allocation: "Our revenue by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers."
    *   **Summary of Footnote:** This means the revenue figures presented are based on where users *are located when they generate revenue* (e.g., viewing an ad), which is an estimated location. This is explicitly stated to be *different* from how revenue is reported in Meta's official financial statements, which use the *physical addresses of their customers* (e.g., advertisers). This distinction is crucial for understanding the nature of the data.

In summary, the document provides a clear, quarter-over-quarter view of Meta's revenue broken down by user geography, highlighting significant overall growth, the consistent dominance of the US & Canada market, and a seasonal revenue pattern. The footnote provides critical context on the data's source and methodology.
