**4. Text Content:**

*   **Main Title:** "Advertising Revenue by User Geography"
*   **Subtitle:** "In Millions"
*   **Company Logo:** "∞ Meta"
*   **Footnote (Bottom Left):**
    "Our revenue by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers."
    *   **Summary of Footnote:** This disclaimer clarifies the methodology used for the geographic allocation of revenue presented in the chart. It states that the figures are based on the estimated geographic location of users at the time of a revenue-generating activity. It explicitly notes that this method is *different* from how revenue is disaggregated by geography in Meta's official consolidated financial statements, where allocation is based on the addresses of their customers. This is an important distinction for understanding the data's context.
