    *   **Summary of Footnote:** This explains that from Q1'24 onwards, ARPP is calculated by dividing Family of Apps (FoA) revenue by the average of Daily Active People (DAP) at the beginning and end of the quarter. It also clarifies that prior period ARPP figures (before Q1'24) have been "recast" or adjusted to align with this new definition, ensuring consistency for comparison across all quarters shown.
*   **Page Number:** The number "11" is visible in the bottom-right corner, indicating this is the eleventh page of a larger document or presentation.
