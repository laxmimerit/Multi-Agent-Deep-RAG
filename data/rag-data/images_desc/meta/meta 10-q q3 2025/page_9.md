This document is a single presentation slide with a clean, minimalist design, primarily featuring a bar chart depicting "Capital Expenditures."

**1. Visual Elements and Layout:**
The slide has a white background.
*   **Header:** In the top left corner, the title "Capital Expenditures" is displayed in a large, dark gray sans-serif font. Directly below it, in a smaller font, is the unit "In Millions."
*   **Logo:** In the top right corner, the "Meta" logo is present. It consists of a stylized infinity symbol (resembling a horizontally oriented figure-eight) followed by the word "Meta," both in a dark gray color.
*   **Main Content:** The central focus is a horizontal bar chart.
*   **Footer:** At the bottom left, there's a small disclaimer text. In the bottom right corner, the page number "9" is displayed.

**2. Charts and Graphs:**
The main visual element is a **vertical bar chart** illustrating Capital Expenditures over different periods.
*   **Chart Type:** Vertical Bar Chart.
*   **Bars:** There are four dark charcoal gray rectangular bars of varying heights, indicating different values.
*   **Y-Axis (Implied):** While there's no explicit Y-axis line or labels, the height of the bars corresponds to the monetary values, which are explicitly stated above each bar. The unit "In Millions" from the slide title applies to these values.
*   **X-Axis:** A thin horizontal gray line forms the baseline for the bars. Below this line are the labels for each period.
    *   **Period Labels:** From left to right: "Q3'24", "Q3'25", "2024", "2025".
    *   **Groupings:** Below these individual period labels, there are two broader categorical labels enclosed in light gray rectangular boxes:
        *   The first light gray box spans underneath "Q3'24" and "Q3'25" and is labeled "Quarterly" in the center in a dark gray font.
        *   The second light gray box spans underneath "2024" and "2025" and is labeled "YTD" in the center in a dark gray font.

*   **Data Trends and Key Insights:**
    The chart shows a clear and significant upward trend in Capital Expenditures across the presented periods. All values are prefixed with a dollar sign ($).
    1.  **Q3'24 (Quarterly):** The first bar represents **$9,202** (Millions).
    2.  **Q3'25 (Quarterly):** The second bar represents **$19,374** (Millions). This shows a substantial increase from Q3'24 to Q3'25, more than doubling.
    3.  **2024 (YTD):** The third bar represents **$24,389** (Millions). This is higher than the individual Q3'25 quarterly figure, as expected for a year-to-date or full-year value.
    4.  **2025 (YTD):** The fourth and tallest bar represents **$50,078** (Millions). This indicates a projected or planned substantial increase in capital expenditures for 2025, more than doubling the 2024 figure.

    **Overall Insight:** Capital expenditures are projected to grow very aggressively from 2024 to 2025, with the 2025 figure being more than five times the Q3'24 quarterly expenditure. The jump between the quarterly Q3'24 and Q3'25 figures is also significant.

**3. Tables:**
There are no distinct tables present on this slide. All numerical data is presented graphically through the bar chart.

**4. Text Content:**
*   **Main Title:** "Capital Expenditures"
*   **Subtitle/Unit:** "In Millions" – indicating that all monetary figures on the slide are in millions of dollars.
*   **X-Axis Group Labels:** "Quarterly" and "YTD".
*   **Footer Disclaimer:** "Capital expenditures for periods presented were related to purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases." This provides context regarding what constitutes "Capital Expenditures" for Meta, specifically mentioning asset acquisition and lease payments.
