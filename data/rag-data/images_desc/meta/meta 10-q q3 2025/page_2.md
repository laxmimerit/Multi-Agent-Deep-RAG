### **5. Text Content**

*   **Main Title and Subtitle:** As described above, "Advertising Revenue by User Geography" and "In Millions."
*   **Company Identifier:** "∞ Meta" logo.
*   **Footnote/Disclaimer (bottom left):** This important text clarifies the methodology behind the presented data:
    *   "Our revenue by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity."
    *   "This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers."
    *   **Summary:** The footnote explicitly states that the geographical revenue breakdown shown in the chart is an *estimation based on user location* during activity, rather than the *customer address-based apportionment* used in official consolidated financial statements. This distinction is crucial for understanding the nature and potential uses of this specific data presentation.
*   **Page Number:** "2" is displayed at the bottom right.
