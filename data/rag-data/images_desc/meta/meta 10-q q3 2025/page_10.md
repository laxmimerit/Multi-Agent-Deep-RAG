**Text Content (Footnotes/Explanatory Text):**
Two paragraphs of explanatory text are provided at the bottom of the page, offering crucial context for the "Family Daily Active People (DAP)" metric:

1.  **Definition of DAP:** The first paragraph defines a "daily active person (DAP)" as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively referred to as "Family" products). This person must have visited at least one of these products via a mobile app or web browser on a given day. It clarifies that users of other Meta products are not included in DAP unless their activities on Family products qualify them.
2.  **Methodology and Limitations:** The second paragraph details the methodology used to calculate DAP. It explains that because Meta does not require users to link accounts across products, complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models are employed to estimate the unique number of individuals using one or more Family products. This involves matching user accounts within and across products to attribute activity to a single person. The text explicitly states that these techniques "require significant judgment" and are developed based on internal reviews and user survey data, implying a "necessarily some margin of error in our estimates." It also refers to a separate section, "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data," for further information. Finally, it notes a specific change: "Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users." This last point is important for understanding potential shifts in the reported numbers from Q4'23 onwards.
