This document page presents a financial analysis of "Revenue by User Geography" for Meta, spanning nine quarters from Q3'23 to Q3'25.

**Overall Layout and Visual Elements:**
The page has a clean, minimalist design with a white background. The company logo, an infinity symbol followed by "Meta," is prominently displayed in the top right corner. The main content is a large stacked column chart, occupying most of the page's upper and central area. Text content includes a main title, a subtitle, a chart legend, and a detailed footnote at the bottom. A page number "3" is located in the bottom right corner. The color palette for the chart is a gradient of blue-grey shades, ranging from dark for the bottom segment to very light for the top segment, providing clear visual differentiation between geographical regions.

**Title and Subtitle:**
The main title, "Revenue by User Geography," is displayed in a large, bold font in the top left corner. Directly beneath it, a subtitle "In Millions" clarifies the units for all revenue figures presented on the page.

**Charts and Graphs:**
The central feature of the page is a **stacked column chart** illustrating Meta's revenue breakdown by user geography over time.

*   **X-axis Labels:** The horizontal axis represents time, labeled with quarterly periods: Q3'23, Q4'23, Q1'24, Q2'24, Q3'24, Q4'24, Q1'25, Q2'25, and Q3'25.
*   **Y-axis (Implicit):** While there isn't an explicit vertical Y-axis line or scale, the height of each stacked column represents the total revenue for that quarter, and the height of each segment within a column represents the revenue from a specific geographical region. All revenue figures are explicitly stated in millions on the chart segments and as a total at the top of each bar.

*   **Chart Segments and Legend:**
    The chart uses four distinct shades of blue-grey to represent different geographical regions, with a legend provided on the right side of the chart:
    *   **Darkest Shade (Bottom Segment):** Labeled "US & Canada"
    *   **Medium-Dark Shade (Second from Bottom):** Labeled "Europe"
    *   **Medium-Light Shade (Third from Bottom):** Labeled "Asia-Pacific"
    *   **Lightest Shade (Top Segment):** Labeled "Rest of World"

*   **Data Trends and Key Insights:**

    *   **Relative Proportions:** The chart visually indicates that the relative proportions of revenue contributed by each geographical segment remain fairly consistent across the quarters, suggesting stable market distribution or growth rates across these regions. US & Canada and Europe combined represent the majority of Meta's revenue.

**Tables:**
There are no separate tables on this page. All numerical data is embedded within the stacked column chart, with specific revenue figures labeled directly on each segment of the bars and as a total at the top of each bar.

**Text Content (Footnote):**
At the bottom of the page, a small paragraph of text serves as an important disclaimer or explanation regarding the data:
"Our revenue by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers."
This note clarifies that the revenue allocation presented in this chart is based on the *user's geographic location during revenue-generating activity*, which is distinct from how revenue might be reported in official financial statements, where it's based on *customer addresses*. This highlights a methodological difference in revenue reporting.
