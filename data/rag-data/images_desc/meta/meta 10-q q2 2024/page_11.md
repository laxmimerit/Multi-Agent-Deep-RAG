    *   It defines ARPP as "FoA revenue" divided by the "average of the number of DAP" (Daily Active People, likely).
    *   Importantly, it states that prior period ARPP figures have been "recast" to ensure comparability with the new definition, meaning all data points on the chart adhere to the same calculation method.
*   **Page Number:** "11" is located at the bottom right corner of the page.
