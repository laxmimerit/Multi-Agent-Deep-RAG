### Charts and Graphs

**Chart Type:** The document features a stacked bar chart, which visually represents Meta's total revenue for each quarter, broken down into contributions from four distinct geographic regions.

**Axes Labels:**
*   **X-axis:** Represents time periods, specifically quarters, ranging from "Q2'22" (Second Quarter of 2022) to "Q2'24" (Second Quarter of 2024). There are nine bars, each corresponding to a quarter.
*   **Y-axis:** While not explicitly labeled with numerical values or a scale, the title "In Millions" and the currency values displayed on each segment of the bars clearly indicate that the Y-axis represents revenue in millions of US dollars.

**Legend:** A legend is provided on the right side of the chart, using four distinct shades of grey/blue to represent the different geographic regions:
*   **Rest of World:** Lightest grey
*   **Asia-Pacific:** Medium grey
*   **Europe:** Darker grey
*   **US & Canada:** Darkest grey/blue

**Data Trends and Key Insights:**

The chart illustrates the total quarterly revenue and its composition by geographic region. Each bar represents a quarter's total revenue, with individual segments showing the revenue generated from US & Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of World. The exact revenue figures for each segment are numerically labeled on the chart, and the total revenue for each quarter is displayed at the top of its respective bar.

**Overall Revenue Trend:**
*   Total revenue generally shows an upward trend over the observed period, despite some quarterly fluctuations.
*   It starts at **$28,822M** in Q2'22, dips slightly to **$27,714M** in Q3'22, then rises to **$32,165M** in Q4'22.
*   Q1'23 sees a dip to **$28,645M**, followed by consistent growth through Q2'23 (**$31,999M**), Q3'23 (**$34,146M**), and a significant peak in Q4'23 at **$40,111M**.
*   Revenue then decreases to **$36,455M** in Q1'24 before rebounding to **$39,071M** in Q2'24.
*   There appears to be a seasonal pattern where Q4 revenues are consistently the highest of the year, followed by a drop in Q1.

**Revenue by Geographic Region:**

1.  **US & Canada (Darkest Segment):**
    *   This region consistently contributes the largest portion of Meta's revenue, often accounting for roughly half or more of the total.
    *   It starts at **$13,249M** in Q2'22, fluctuates, and reaches its peak at **$18,585M** in Q4'23.
    *   By Q2'24, it stands at **$16,847M**, showing strong overall growth from the beginning of the period.

2.  **Europe (Darker Grey Segment):**
    *   Europe is the second-largest revenue contributor.
    *   It starts at **$6,452M** in Q2'22 and generally shows an increasing trend, reaching **$9,441M** in Q4'23.
    *   By Q2'24, its revenue is **$9,300M**, demonstrating substantial growth over the period.

3.  **Asia-Pacific (Medium Grey Segment):**
    *   This region is the third-largest contributor, with revenues generally on an upward trajectory.
    *   Starting at **$5,908M** in Q2'22, it shows steady growth, reaching **$7,512M** in Q4'23.
    *   By Q2'24, its revenue is **$7,888M**, indicating consistent expansion.

4.  **Rest of World (Lightest Grey Segment):**
    *   This segment represents the smallest, but also shows a clear upward trend in revenue.
    *   It begins at **$3,213M** in Q2'22 and grows consistently, peaking at **$4,667M** in Q1'24.
    *   By Q2'24, it reaches **$5,036M**, demonstrating the strongest percentage growth among all regions over the observed period, more than doubling its initial contribution.

**Summary of Trends:** All four geographic regions contribute to the overall revenue growth. US & Canada and Europe remain the dominant markets, while Asia-Pacific and Rest of World show strong, consistent growth, indicating increasing global reach and monetization. The Q4 peaks are primarily driven by significant increases across all regions, especially US & Canada and Europe.

*   **Company Logo:** The "Meta" logo indicates the company to which this financial data pertains.
*   **Footnote/Disclaimer:** Located at the bottom of the page, this text provides crucial context and methodology:
    "Our revenue by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers."
    This disclaimer highlights that the geographical allocation presented here is based on user activity location, which may differ from official financial statements that might use customer billing addresses for geographic apportionment. This is an important distinction for interpreting the data.
