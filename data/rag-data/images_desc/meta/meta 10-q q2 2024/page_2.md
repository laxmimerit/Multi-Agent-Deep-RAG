**3. Tables:**
There are no explicit tables on this page. All numerical data is integrated directly into the stacked bar chart.

**4. Text Content (Footnote/Disclaimer):**
At the bottom-left of the page, there is a small disclaimer text:
"Our revenue by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers."

*   **Summary:** This footnote clarifies the methodology used for this specific revenue breakdown. It states that the geographical allocation here is based on the *user's location* when they generate revenue, which is distinct from the company's official financial statement disclosures where revenue is apportioned based on the *customer's address*. This highlights that the data presented is an internal operational view rather than a strict financial reporting metric.
