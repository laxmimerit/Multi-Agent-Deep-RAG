This document page, titled "Average Price Per Ad YoY Percentage Change," provides a detailed analysis of the year-over-year percentage change in the average price per ad across five different geographical regions over five quarters. The page is clean and professional, with a white background and dark gray text. The Meta logo (an infinity symbol followed by "Meta") is prominently displayed in the top right corner. The page number "13" is in the bottom right corner.

The core of the page consists of **five bar charts**, arranged in a 2x3 grid (three charts on the top row, two on the bottom row, with the sixth position empty). Each chart represents a different geographical segment, clearly labeled in a light gray rectangular box below its X-axis.

**General Characteristics of all Charts:**

*   **Type:** All are vertical bar charts.
*   **Metric:** The Y-axis (though not explicitly labeled with numbers, the percentages are shown above/below each bar) represents the Year-over-Year (YoY) percentage change in the average price per ad.
*   **X-axis:** The X-axis for all charts represents time, specifically five consecutive quarters: Q2'23, Q3'23, Q4'23, Q1'24, and Q2'24.
*   **Data Representation:** Bars extending above the implied zero line indicate positive YoY growth, while bars extending below indicate negative YoY growth. The exact percentage is labeled directly above or below each bar. The bars are a dark teal/blue color.

**Detailed Description of Each Chart:**

1.  **Worldwide (Top Left Chart)**
    *   **Region:** Worldwide
    *   **Data Trends:**
        *   Q2'23: (16)% (a significant decline)
        *   Q3'23: (6)% (a lesser decline, showing improvement)
        *   Q4'23: 2% (turned positive, indicating recovery)
        *   Q1'24: 6% (continued positive growth)
        *   Q2'24: 10% (stronger positive growth)
    *   **Insight:** The average price per ad worldwide experienced a sharp decline in Q2'23, followed by a steady and strong recovery, turning positive by Q4'23 and reaching 10% YoY growth by Q2'24.

2.  **US & Canada (Top Middle Chart)**
    *   **Region:** US & Canada
    *   **Data Trends:**
        *   Q2'23: (14)% (a significant decline)
        *   Q3'23: (7)% (a lesser decline)
        *   Q4'23: 2% (turned positive)
        *   Q1'24: 5% (continued positive growth)
        *   Q2'24: 9% (stronger positive growth)
    *   **Insight:** Similar to the worldwide trend, US & Canada saw a substantial drop in Q2'23, followed by a consistent recovery, achieving 9% YoY growth by Q2'24. The recovery trajectory is very similar to the worldwide trend.

3.  **Europe (Top Right Chart)**
    *   **Region:** Europe
    *   **Data Trends:**
        *   Q2'23: (9)% (a moderate decline, less severe than Worldwide or US & Canada)
        *   Q3'23: 8% (a strong and rapid rebound, turning significantly positive)
        *   Q4'23: 14% (continued strong growth)
        *   Q1'24: 18% (further strong growth)
        *   Q2'24: 18% (growth plateaued at this level)
    *   **Insight:** Europe experienced a milder initial decline compared to other major regions and demonstrated a very strong and quick recovery, reaching 18% YoY growth by Q1'24, which it maintained into Q2'24. This region shows one of the strongest and most consistent positive performances from Q3'23 onwards.

4.  **Asia-Pacific (Bottom Left Chart)**
    *   **Region:** Asia-Pacific
    *   **Data Trends:**
        *   Q2'23: (22)% (the most severe decline among all regions)
        *   Q3'23: (14)% (still a significant decline)
        *   Q4'23: (6)% (decline lessened)
        *   Q1'24: (3)% (decline almost mitigated)
        *   Q2'24: 4% (finally turned positive, but modestly)
    *   **Insight:** Asia-Pacific had the steepest initial drop in average ad price and the slowest recovery. It remained in negative YoY territory until Q2'24, when it achieved a modest 4% positive growth. This region lags significantly behind others in its recovery.

5.  **Rest of World (Bottom Middle Chart)**
    *   **Region:** Rest of World
    *   **Data Trends:**
        *   Q2'23: (12)% (a significant decline)
        *   Q3'23: 7% (a strong and rapid rebound, turning positive)
        *   Q4'23: 13% (continued strong growth)
        *   Q1'24: 20% (further very strong growth)
        *   Q2'24: 24% (the strongest positive growth among all regions)
    *   **Insight:** After a notable decline in Q2'23, the Rest of World region showed a very robust and accelerating recovery, achieving the highest YoY growth rate of 24% by Q2'24. Its performance from Q3'23 onwards is exceptional.

**Overall Trends and Key Insights:**

*   **Universal Decline and Recovery:** All geographical regions experienced a year-over-year decline in average price per ad in Q2'23. However, all regions subsequently showed a trend towards recovery, though at varying speeds and magnitudes.
*   **Varying Recovery Pace:** Europe and Rest of World demonstrated the strongest and fastest recoveries, achieving significant positive YoY growth by Q3'23 or Q4'23 and maintaining strong momentum. US & Canada and Worldwide followed a similar, slightly less aggressive recovery path.
*   **Asia-Pacific Lag:** Asia-Pacific stands out as the slowest to recover, experiencing the deepest initial decline and only turning positive in Q2'24 with modest growth.
*   **Strongest Performers (Q2'24):** By Q2'24, Rest of World and Europe were leading with 24% and 18% YoY growth, respectively.
*   **Weakest Performer (Q2'24):** Asia-Pacific at 4% YoY growth.

**Text Content (Footnote):**

At the bottom of the page, there is a small disclaimer:
"Our average price per ad growth by user geography is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered."

**Summary of Main Points from Footnote:**
This note clarifies the methodology used for geographical segmentation. It states that the allocation of ad price growth to a specific region is based on an *estimation* of the user's geographical location *at the time the ad impression was delivered*, rather than, for example, the user's registered home address or the advertiser's location. This is an important detail for understanding the data's basis.

**Visual Elements and Layout:**
The page is minimalist and data-focused. The use of a grid for the charts creates a clear, organized comparison across regions. The consistent labeling and bar chart format make the trends easy to digest at a glance. The color scheme is simple, using dark gray for text and a dark teal for the bars, providing good contrast against the white background. The Meta branding is subtle but present.
