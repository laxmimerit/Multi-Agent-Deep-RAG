**Text Content:**

*   **Main Title:** "Family Average Revenue per Person (ARPP)" - This clearly states the metric being tracked.
*   **Company Branding:** The Meta logo (an infinity symbol followed by "Meta") is displayed in the top right.
*   **Footnote (Bottom Left):**
    *   "Beginning with this quarter, we define average revenue per person (ARPP) as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of DAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. We have recast ARPP in prior periods for comparative purposes."
    *   **Summary of Footnote:** This text provides a crucial definition and methodological note. It states that the calculation method for ARPP has changed starting "this quarter" (likely Q1'24, the most recent quarter shown). The new definition is "FoA revenue" (Family of Apps revenue, implied) for a quarter divided by the average of Daily Active People (DAP) at the beginning and end of that quarter. Importantly, it also mentions that ARPP figures for prior periods have been "recast" (recalculated using the new definition) to ensure consistent comparison across all quarters presented in the chart.

**Key Insights:**
The page illustrates Meta's Family Average Revenue per Person, showing a general growth trend from Q1'22 to Q1'24, with noticeable seasonal peaks in Q4. The accompanying footnote is vital for understanding that the ARPP definition has been updated and historical data adjusted for comparability, suggesting a shift in how Meta calculates and presents this key metric.
