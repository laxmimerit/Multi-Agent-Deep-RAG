      "*   **Revenue vs. Valuation:** Microsoft’s Q2 2024 revenue of ~$69.6 billion set a high bar for the company. The current market capitalization of approximately $3.54 trillion indicates that the market is pricing MSFT at roughly 12-13 times its trailing annual revenue, a premium valuation driven by its leadership in Generative AI.\n",
      "*   **Stock Growth:** Since the Q2 2024 results were announced, Microsoft's stock has traded within a high range ($344.79 - $555.45). The current price of $476.12 is significantly above its 52-week lows, though it sits below its recent all-time highs, suggesting some market consolidation after the massive AI-driven rally.\n",
      "*   **Earnings Efficiency:** With a net income of $24.1 billion on $69.6 billion in revenue (a ~34% net profit margin), Microsoft remains highly efficient. This profitability supports its current P/E ratio of 33.89, which is high compared to the broader market but consistent with large-cap technology peers.\n",
